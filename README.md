# pig_dice
This is an online game that outputs numbers from one to six randomly assuming
that one is rolling a dice when they click of the roll button.

## Specifications

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
*If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
*If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
*If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
*The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
