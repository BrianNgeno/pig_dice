# pig_dice
This is an online game that outputs numbers from one to six randomly assuming
that one is rolling a dice when they click of the roll button.

## Specifications

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
* If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
* The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* This game can be viewed on any web browser available on your device.

## Known Bugs
There are no unresolved issues in regards to this code that I know of.

## Prerequisites
To be able to run this web application, you will need to have a web browser, preferably Google Chrome.

## Technologies Used
I worked on this code on Linux OS. I used HTML to write the code, CSS and Bootstrap to style and organize it; 
JavaScript and the jQuery-3.3.1.min library for functionality purposes, and Markdown language on the ABOUTME section. 
I created the code using Atom and Git applications.
